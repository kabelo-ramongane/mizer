# mizer
command line program to automate python project setup similar in concept to "create-react-app" for beginner React Developers.

it automates the general workflow to writing a python script or starting a python project, viz:

## manual script workflow setup:
1. create empty file
2. add shebang line
3. add executable permissions to file

## manual project workflow setup:
1. create empty directory
2. create virtual environment
3. activate virtual environment
4. create main file
5. add shebang line
6. add executable permissions to file

mizer will automate either one of the workflows depending on the arguments it receives.
